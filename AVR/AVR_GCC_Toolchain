If you want to be sure your gcc tools are complete:
sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential

You'll want these packages for the basic toolchain:
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude
Recommended by avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net

Suggested packages:
avrdude-doc task-c-devel gcc-doc gdb-doc
I installed the documentation and skipped task-c-devel (I don't know what that does).

If you want to read more, the avr-libc-user-manual has been pretty good! I got it by downloading the Atmel Toolchain from the Atmel website, but I'm sure you can find it elsewhere.

When compiling code for AVR processors, use the command:
avr-gcc

To program chips using an ISP or a debugger, I use:
avrdude

Files are installed in:
/usr/lib/avr
