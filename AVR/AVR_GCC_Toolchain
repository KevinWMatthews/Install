I installed this based on a 3rd-party website recommendation:
sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential
Looks like it can't hurt.

You'll want these packages for the basic toolchain:
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude
Recommended by avr-eclips.sourceforge.net

Extra packages:
libftdi1

No longer needed: (?)
libjs-jquery rubygems-integration

Suggested (and installed):
avrdude-doc gdb-doc

If you want to read more, the avr-libc-user-manual has been pretty good! I got it by downloading the Atmel Toolchain from the Atmel website, but I'm sure you can find it elsewhere.

Files are installed in:
/usr/lib/avr
