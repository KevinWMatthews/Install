### Install process ###
Fork and clone the repo from Git:
https://github.com/buserror/simavr

It won't compile.

Read the manual, which recommends installing
sudo apt-get install elfutils

The manual also recommended
sudo apt-get install clang



Getting a warning:
WARNING cores/sim_mega128rfr2.c did not compile, check your avr-gcc toolchain
The manual says that this is because we have the wrong director for AVR_ROOT.

Looked through bits about setting AVR_ROOT in the akefile but it looked to be set up fine.
Tried passing AVR_ROOT=/usr/lib/avr but it didn't seem to help.
It does keep compiling, so let's forget about this for now. Maybe I just won't use the ATmega128 ;)
But when I do... :/

Continuing, it still wouldn't compile because it couldn't find
<libelf.h>
Poked around online and found a recommendation to install:
sudo apt-get install libelfg0
sudo apt-get install libelfg0-dev

libelfg0 was already installed.
libelfg0-dev was installed.
  Progress!! It now finds libelf.h


Now it can't find <GL/glut.h>
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev

It builds! There's still the cores/sim_mega128rfr2.c warning, and there are a few
warnings within their code, but it seems to build fine.
