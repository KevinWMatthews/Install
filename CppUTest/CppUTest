You can download and unpack a tarball and then run the configure scripts.
This will get you the latest and greates.
Refer to README.md for instructions. It's ok, they aren't that hard to follow. Really!


OK...
If you get an error stating that:
Makefile.am:37: warning: source file '<filename>' is in a subdirectory,
Makefile.am:37: but option 'subdir-objects' is disabled
automake: warning: possible forward-incompatibility.
automake: At least a source file is in a subdirectory, but the 'subdir-objects'
automake: automake option hasn't been enabled.  For now, the corresponding output
automake: object file(s) will be placed in the top-level directory.  However,
automake: this behaviour will change in future Automake versions: they will
automake: unconditionally cause object files to be placed in the same subdirectory
automake: of the corresponding sources.
automake: You are advised to start using 'subdir-objects' option throughout your
automake: project, to avoid future incompatibilities.

Then you need to add subdir-objects as an option to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
You can do this by
  opening configure.ac and replacing
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
  with
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(subdir-objects)
WOO!

Huh, that caused a make error.

I looked in the Install file (a readme, really) and it leaves out the ./autogen.sh step
I just ran .configure, make, and sudo make install
That has worked so far... it installed but it still can't find all of the mock files. BOO!


I've also tried using sudo apt-get install cpputest.
This installs the header files in
/usr/include/CppUTest and /usr/include/CppUTestExt
It works but gave me a very old version.


There are a bunch of shell scripts that you can use to easily create the files needed for testing (I think).
They are located in /usr/share/cpputest/scripts

Once installed they'll be located in /usr/local/bin (to enable ease of use).
To install the scripts, run
sudo ./InstallScripts.sh

You may need to run
(sudo) chmod a+x *.sh
to add execute privilege to the scripts.

They are located directly in /usr/local/bin
Maybe I'll want to move them into a subfolder?


Look in /usr/share/doc/cpputest



I had a bad package floating around. Once I removed it I was able to go in and recompile and install from source.
Look into the bad directory. Let them know?
Remove CppUTest and reinstall it so that I can update this.
