You can download and unpack a tarball and then run the configure scripts.

This time I tried apt-get install cpputest.
This installs the header files in
/usr/include/CppUTest and /usr/include/CppUTestExt



There are a bunch of shell scripts that you can use to easily create the files needed for testing (I think).
They are located in /usr/share/cpputest/scripts

Once installed they'll be located in /usr/local/bin (to enable ease of use).
To install the scripts, run
sudo ./InstallScripts.sh

You may need to run
(sudo) chmod a+x *.sh
to add execute privilege to the scripts.

They are located directly in /usr/local/bin
Maybe I'll want to move them into a subfolder?


Look in /usr/share/doc/cpputest
