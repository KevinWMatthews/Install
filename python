Ummmm, yeah. Not so sure about this one.

I had pip and python 2.7 installed at work.
sudo pip install virtualenv
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

This installed (after a failure?) and 'which virtualenv' returned fine, but 'virtualenv' wouldn't run.
I ran
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
and then it worked fine.
Should I run
export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
?

The same stack overflow post suggested that I do, but I didn't.
