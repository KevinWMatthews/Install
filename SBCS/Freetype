Download Freetype tarball from SourceForge
This doesnt' work: Read the docs:
	unzip
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
That didn't work. We need the dependent libraries? Read the bottom of ./configure's output

Try this:
./configure --without-harfbuzz
make
make install

Install HarfBuzz
*whew*

Then run
./configure
make
make install


Check /usr/include for freetype2
WOO HOO!
