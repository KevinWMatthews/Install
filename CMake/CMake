CMake

Recommended getting an IDE:
codeblocks or eclipse

It automatically installs cmake-data.

apt-get installs version 2.8.12. I want something more up-to-date.

Download the latest tarball from cmake's website
  run
./bootstrap
make
sudo make install

Later ran
sudo apt-get install cmake
which installed only
cmake-data
Hope that didn't screw anything up, but now cmake --version works.
